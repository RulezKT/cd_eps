The angle of the Earth's axial tilt with respect to the orbital plane (the obliquity of the ecliptic) varies between 22.1° and 24.5°, over a cycle of about 41,000 years. The current tilt is 23.44°, roughly halfway between its extreme values. The tilt last reached its maximum in 8,700 BCE. It is now in the decreasing phase of its cycle, and will reach its minimum around the year 11,800 CE.[12]

24.5° = 0.4276056667386107

22.1° = 0.38571776469074687

23.44° = 0.40910517666747087

To find a weighted average, multiply each number by its weight, then add the results.
If the weights don’t add up to one, find the sum of all the variables multiplied by their weight, then divide by the sum of the weights.

so:
eps change in 1 sec = - 0.0000000000000719475504
eps(64 seconds) = 0.4090926005959778955745
eps-(0 seconds) = 0.4090926006005825565914
